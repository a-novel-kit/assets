## How I built the logos

Layout and organization are made using [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/), as I find it more convenient for 
dealing with precision work.

Coloration and effects are applied through [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).

Elements created in paint are exported as individual PNGs that are imported as layers in Gimp. You can find all those 
files in the build folder for each asset.

## Font reference
